# Low mutation regime exploration
# Based on analysis showing best diversity at mutation_prob=0.005

# VLM evaluation

  eval_frequency: 37500  # 4 times across run
  eval_trajectory: false

# Focus on low mutation + varying copy distance
# Hypothesis: Lower copy_dist → more species coexistence but less copying
sweep:
  # Very low mutation rates (stable evolution)
  mutation_prob:
    - 0.001  # Very stable
    - 0.002  # Stable
    - 0.005  # Sweet spot from analysis
    - 0.01   # Moderate

  # Copy distance: small→coexistence, large→mixing
  max_copy_dist:
    - 0.03   # Very local (high coexistence)
    - 0.06   # Local (moderate coexistence)
    - 0.10   # Medium range
    - 0.15   # Wide range (low coexistence)

  # Copy probability: how often copying happens
  copy_prob:
    - 0.0005 # Rare
    - 0.002  # Moderate

  # Species dimensionality (reduced to fit GPU memory)
  # Note: 6D and 8D cause OOM even with 2500 particles
  species_dim:
    - 2      # Baseline
    - 4      # Moderate (fits on 4GB GPU with 4000 particles)
